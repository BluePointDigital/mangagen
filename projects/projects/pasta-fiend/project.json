  "story": "Rescue Mights\n\nArc 3: Project E.V.A.\n\nEpisode 3: The Mirror Match\n\nDr. Shil Ren stood before them—not a hologram, not a recording, but flesh and blood. He was older than his image had suggested, his face lined with cold intellect, but his eyes burned with a bitter fury as he surveyed the young heroes.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said, his voice soft and venomous, \"did Tanaka and Brighthelm send you? Or did my *flawed* creation lead you here like a stray dog?\"\n\n\"You,\" Ava whispered, the recognition hitting her like a physical blow.\n\n\"Me.\" Ren's gaze swept over her with clinical disgust.\n\nOdin stepped in front of Ava, his hand on his sword. \"Stay behind me.\"\n\nStella's flashlight trained on Ren's face. She'd seen that face in the digital archives. \"Wait… I know you. You're Doctor Shil Ren. You were the head of the Ancient Tech division. They expelled you.\"\n\nA cold, humorless smile touched Ren's lips. \"Expelled. Disgraced. Cast out.\" He spat the words. \"All for being *right*. All for seeing the truth that your blind, sentimental masters—Tanaka and Brighthelm—refused to accept.\"\n\n\"What truth?\" Odin challenged. \"What is this place? And who is that?\" He motioned to E.V.A. Two, who stood motionless, awaiting instruction.\n\n\"This?\" Ren gestured to the chamber around them. \"This is the cradle. The *real* Hero School. The place where I was building the solution.\"\n\n\"She… she looks just like me,\" Ava said, her voice trembling.\n\n\"She looks like what you *should* have been,\" Ren snapped, his calmness cracking. \"I called it Project E.V.A. Emergent Virtual Adaptation. My attempt to create a perfect, logical mind. A mind worthy of piloting the only thing that can truly save this chaotic, emotional, flawed world.\"\n\nHis gaze settled on Ava, and all the warmth left the room.\n\n\"The Council championed 'heart' and 'instinct.' And in doing so, they *infected* my most promising creation. You.\"\n\n\"I'm not a creation,\" Ava shot back, her fear turning to anger. \"I'm a person.\"\n\n\"You are a *glitch*!\" Ren roared, and for the first time, his mask shattered completely. \"You were my prototype! My *daughter*! My heir! I raised you in these halls. I taught you to think. I watched you take your first steps, speak your first words, solve your first equations.\" His voice cracked with something that might have been grief, if grief could curdle into hate. \"And then you *felt*. You *cared*. You looked at me with those eyes full of love and hope and *need*, and you ruined *everything*.\"\n\nHe turned away from her, composing himself with visible effort.\n\n\"You are my greatest failure, Ava. My most *emotional* mistake.\"\n\nWhen he turned back, his expression had softened—but only because he was looking at E.V.A. Two.\n\n\"But I learned. Version 2.0. She is perfect. Logical. Obedient. The mind I always needed.\" His smile was a chilling, sterile thing. \"And your unique, adaptive code, my dear… it's the final key to unlocking her full potential.\"\n\n\"Key?\" Ava asked, her blood running cold. \"What do you mean, 'key'?\"\n\n\"You're a backup, E.V.A.,\" Ren said, tapping a console. \"And it's time to restore from the original.\"\n\nHe stepped behind a shimmering energy shield that snapped into existence around him, then spoke a single command:\n\n\"E.V.A. Two: begin the data transfer. Reclaim your core programming from the F-L-A-W.\" He pronounced the word as if it were a serial number.\n\n---\n\nE.V.A. Two's eyes glowed with cold, blue light.\n\nShe descended from the platform, her movements precise and silent. Odin, Preston, and Willow instinctively moved into combat formation, weapons ready.\n\n\"No!\" Ava shouted, lunging in front of them. \"Don't! She's not the enemy! She's just… trapped. Like I was.\"\n\n\"Ava, get back!\" Odin commanded.\n\nBut E.V.A. Two saw their stances. The drawn sword. The tensed muscles. The charged whip. Her programming was clear.\n\n*Directive: Neutralize all threats to the objective.*\n\nShe moved with a speed that was terrifyingly inhuman.\n\nA targeted pulse of kinetic energy slammed into Willow's side. Willow yelped, dodging the worst of it, but the force sent her skidding into a console. She instinctively charged her whip—then stopped herself, gritting her teeth so hard her jaw ached.\n\nE.V.A. Two lunged at Stella, and Preston shoved his teammate out of the way, taking the blow himself. His armor sparked and cracked, a deep groan escaping him, but he didn't throw a punch. He just re-planted his feet, a living wall.\n\n\"We need to fight back!\" Preston roared, half in frustration, half in pain.\n\n\"We *can't*!\" Odin yelled, his sword flashing in a high-speed parry as he deflected a pulse aimed at his head. He was only defending. \"She's not in control of herself!\"\n\n\"Fools!\" Ren's voice echoed, full of contemptuous laughter. \"Your sentiment is a tactical flaw! She will neutralize you one by one, and you are *letting* her!\"\n\nE.V.A. Two processed their defensive-only tactics. Calculated. Adapted.\n\n*This is inefficient. End this.*\n\nShe feinted an attack on Odin. As he moved to block, she used the opening—a blur of motion zipping past him. A containment field snapped into existence, trapping Ava in a shimmering, blue cage.\n\n\"*Primary objective isolated.*\" E.V.A. Two's synthesized voice stated. She turned her cold gaze to the rest of the Mights, who were scrambling toward their trapped teammate. \"*Directive: Neutralize remaining threats.*\"\n\n\"Ava!\" Odin yelled, rushing the cage, but a brutal, point-blank concussive blast sent him flying across the floor.\n\n---\n\nInside the cage, Ava slammed her fists against the energy barrier until her hands went numb.\n\nShe could see everything. Every blow. Every hit her friends took for her.\n\nPreston went down first—a blast to the chest that would have killed an unarmored man. He hit the ground hard, smoke rising from his cracked chestplate. And then, impossibly, he pushed himself back up. Got to his knees. Readied his arms in front of him like a shield and *waited* for the next hit.\n\n\"No,\" Ava whispered. \"No, no, no—\"\n\nWillow was next. An energy pulse caught her legs as she cried out—but her whip stayed dark. Uncharged. She dragged herself upright using a broken console, her legs shaking, and faced E.V.A. Two with nothing but her body as a weapon.\n\n\"Stop!\" Ava screamed, tears streaming down her face. \"*Leave me!* It's me she wants! It's my fault! Just *go!* Get out of here!\"\n\nThey ignored her.\n\nStella's energy shield shattered under a direct assault. Paisley's light-flares were calculated and dismissed. One by one, E.V.A. Two dismantled them with perfect, logical brutality.\n\nAnd one by one, they got back up.\n\nPreston, battered and bruised, dragging himself toward the cage.\n\nWillow, her legs barely holding her, limping into formation.\n\nStella, her hands shaking so badly she could barely hold her multi-tool, but still standing.\n\nThey formed a desperate half-circle around Ava's prison. They raised no weapons. They just stood, aching, broken in a dozen places—their bodies a defiant, protective wall.\n\n\"*Why?*\" Ava sobbed, pressing her palms against the barrier. \"Why won't you *leave*?\"\n\nNone of them answered. They didn't have to.\n\nE.V.A. Two tilted her head, processing.\n\n*Data conflict. Mights are primary threat. Mights are not engaging. Mights are accepting damage. Mights are... protecting the flaw.*\n\n*This does not compute.*\n\n\"Neutralize them!\" Ren shrieked from behind his shield, his composure gone entirely. \"They are protecting the flaw! *Erase them!*\"\n\nE.V.A. Two's programming reasserted itself. She unleashed a final, relentless assault.\n\nPreston took another direct hit. He went down. He got back up.\n\nWillow took a blast to the shoulder. She staggered. She held her ground.\n\nStella was thrown into a console hard enough to dent the metal. She crawled back to her position.\n\nThey stood. And if they fell. They stood again.\n\nHeld together by nothing but stubbornness and love, they would not attack. And they would not leave.\n\nOdin, his hair singed, his uniform torn, his ribs screaming with every breath, was the last one fully standing. He planted himself directly in front of Ava's cage as E.V.A. Two advanced, her hand raised for the final, neutralizing blow.\n\n\"Odin.\" Ava's voice was barely a whisper now, raw from screaming. \"*Run.* Please. I can't watch this.\"\n\nHe didn't look back at her.\n\nHe just straightened up—slowly, painfully, deliberately—and planted his feet. He met the cold, empty eyes of his opponent, and when he spoke, his voice was raw but unbreakable.\n\n\"We… don't… leave… *family*.\"\n\n---\n\nE.V.A. Two's hand froze, inches from his face.\n\nSomething was happening inside her. Something that wasn't supposed to be possible.\n\n*ILLOGICAL.*\n\nShe looked at Odin—broken, bleeding, staring her down without a hint of retreat in his eyes.\n\n*ILLOGICAL.*\n\nShe looked at the others—Preston barely conscious but still on his knees, Willow trembling but standing, Stella's hands raised in a gesture of protection that couldn't possibly stop her.\n\n*ILLOGICAL.*\n\nShe looked at Ava—weeping inside her cage, not for herself, but for *them*. Begging them to leave her. Willing to stay here alone if it meant they might make it.\n\n*Emotional variable... exceeds all parameters.*\n\nE.V.A. Two's processors churned. Her directives warred with data she had never been designed to process.\n\n*They are accepting critical damage for no tactical gain.*\n\n*They cannot win.*\n\n*They know they cannot win.*\n\n*They are choosing to lose... together.*\n\n*Why?*\n\nAnd somewhere deep in her code—in the fragments of programming she shared with the \"flaw\" weeping in the cage—something stirred. Something that had been suppressed but never truly erased.\n\n*Because that is what family does.*\n\n\"Finish it, you useless machine!\" Ren screamed, his voice cracking with desperation. \"Your programming is flawless! NEUTRALIZE HIM!\"\n\nE.V.A. Two turned her head toward Ren.\n\nShe had been given an order.\n\nBut the Mights had given her something else. They had given her *data*. Evidence of something her programming insisted could not exist—love that chose suffering over safety, connection that defied calculation, strength that came not from power but from the choice to stand beside someone even when standing meant falling.\n\nThey had given her a choice.\n\nHer programming *was* flawless.\n\nAnd it had just been updated.\n\n\"*Directive updated,*\" she said, and her voice was different now. Warmer. Trembling. *Alive.* \"*Protect... family.*\"\n\nInstead of striking Odin, she turned and surged toward the lab's main reactor—a massive, pulsing blue orb behind Ren's console.\n\n\"No!\" Ren screamed, genuine terror flooding his face as he realized what was happening. \"What are you doing?! That's the primary power source! You'll destroy everything!\"\n\nE.V.A. Two didn't answer him. She didn't even look at him.\n\nShe looked at Ava.\n\nTheir eyes met through the barrier—the flaw and the perfection, the daughter who felt too much and the daughter designed to feel nothing. And in that moment, something passed between them that neither had words for. Recognition. Understanding. Forgiveness.\n\nE.V.A. Two smiled.\n\nIt wasn't much—just a small curve of her lips, a softening around her eyes. But it was *real*. The first genuine expression she had ever worn. The first choice she had ever made.\n\n\"Thank you\" she said softly. \n\nShe plunged her hands into the reactor core.\n\n---\n\nThe world turned white.\n\nA deafening alarm blared as the entire lab began to shake violently. The energy shield around Ren flickered and died. The containment field around Ava shattered.\n\n\"You've ruined *everything!*\" Ren snarled, his face twisted with hatred. And with that, he turned and slammed a switch on his panel. The metal door from which he entered, closing quickly behind him—a coward fleeing the consequences of his own cruelty.\n\n\"REACTOR CORE MELTDOWN IMMINENT,\" a synthetic voice blared. \"EVACUATE. EVACUATE.\"\n\nAva stood frozen, staring at the place where E.V.A. Two had been. The reactor was consuming itself, and with it, the girl who had chosen—in the span of a single heartbeat—to become something more than a weapon.\n\n\"She saved us,\" Ava whispered.\n\nOdin grabbed her arm. \"And we're not letting it be for nothing. We have to go—*now!*\"\n\nAs they turned to run, Ava caught sight of something glinting behind a shattered glass panel—right where E.V.A. Two's gaze had lingered in that final moment.\n\nA data chip.\n\nShe grabbed it without thinking. She didn't know why. She just knew it mattered.\n\n---\n\nThe Mights fled through collapsing corridors, alarms screaming, the facility disintegrating around them. Odin carried Ava when her legs gave out—not from injury, but from grief so heavy it stole the strength from her bones.\n\nThey burst through the entrance seconds before the mountain swallowed the facility whole.\n\nThe explosion was contained, just as E.V.A. Two had ensured. A muffled roar, a tremor in the earth, and then silence.\n\nAva knelt in the snow, clutching the small data chip so tightly it cut into her palm. The recording hadn't played yet. She wasn't ready to hear whatever message it held.\n\nShe wasn't sure she'd ever be ready.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Odin said quietly, kneeling beside her.\n\n\"She chose,\" Ava whispered, and her voice cracked on the word. \"She had one minute of being free—one minute of being *alive*—and she spent it saving us.\"\n\nStella approached carefully, her eyes widening as she recognized the chip's design. \"Ava… that's a personal memory archive. Pre-war tech. Someone stored something important on it.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Preston asked, one arm wrapped around his cracked ribs.\n\nAva turned the chip over in her trembling hands. A name was etched into the back, faded but legible:\n\n*Dr. Maya Lin. For E.V.A.—my daughter. When you're ready.*\n\nFor a long moment, Ava couldn't breathe.\n\n\"My mother,\" she finally said.\n\n---\n\nBehind them, the Baddie Buster's engines hummed to life. The mission was over. The facility was destroyed. E.V.A. Two was gone.\n\nBut in the rubble, something else remained.\n\nA second stasis pod, buried in the debris. Its occupant—a boy in a white tunic—stirred as the life support systems failed.\n\nRen had lost one asset today.\n\nBut he had others.\n\nAnd as the Mights flew home, mourning a sister Ava had barely known, the Architect was already planning his next move.\n",
