  "story": "Rescue Mights\n\nArc 1: The Ruiner Rivalry\n### Episode 1: The Glass Ceiling\n\nThe wind at two thousand feet doesn't howl. It screams.\n\nOdin stood at the edge of the Baddie Buster's open cargo ramp, one hand gripping the hydraulic rail, the other pressed to his comm. Below him, the Zenith District's construction platform was dying — a skeletal frame of steel and glass tilting forty degrees off true, groaning like a wounded animal. Three workers clung to a stabilizing cable, their harnesses the only thing between them and the city far, far below.\n\n\"Ava. What's the Wind Shear?\" Odin asked.\n\n\"Forty knots, gusting to fifty-five.\" Her voice was short, precise — a metronome in the chaos. \"Secondary anchor is fracturing. You have ninety seconds before total structural failure.\"\n\nNinety seconds. Odin had done rescues in less. But ninety seconds with three lives and fifty-five knot gusts? It would be close.\n\n\"Stella, cable tension?\"\n\n\"Twelve percent past tolerance and climbing. That cable snaps, they're gone.\"\n\n\"Preston. Willow. On my mark.\"\n\nThe Buster banked hard, Paisley threading the ship between two support pylons with the casual precision of threading a needle. Preston was already moving, his heavy gauntlets humming with magnetic force. Willow crouched beside him, her energy whip coiled and ready, body tensed like a drawn bow.\n\n\"Mark.\"\n\nPreston launched first — a blur of reinforced armor and raw power. He hit the tilting platform with a metallic shriek, his gauntlets locking onto the primary support beam with enough force to dent the steel. The platform lurched, then steadied. Not fixed. Just... paused.\n\n\"Holding,\" Preston grunted through gritted teeth. \"But not for long. Move.\"\n\nWillow was already gone. She flowed across the failing structure like water over glass, her whip singing through the air. The first worker — a woman with terror-white knuckles — felt the whip coil gently around her waist before she was airborne, yanked toward the Buster's waiting ramp with surgical accuracy.\n\n\"One,\" Willow called.\n\nThe platform screamed again. A rivet the size of Odin's fist shot past his head and vanished into the clouds.\n\n\"Sixty seconds,\" Ava reported. No inflection. Just data.\n\nThe second worker was heavier, panicking, thrashing against his harness. Willow adjusted mid-swing, compensating for his movement with a twist of her wrist that looked effortless and was anything but. He landed on the ramp in a heap, gasping.\n\n\"Two.\"\n\n\"Thirty seconds. Preston, the anchor — \"\n\n\"I see it.\"\n\nThe third worker was the farthest out, clinging to a section of cable that was actively unraveling. Willow's whip couldn't reach. The angles were wrong, the wind too vicious.\n\nOdin moved.\n\nHe stepped off the ramp into open air, his grapple line firing a heartbeat later. The world became a blur of steel and sky as he swung beneath the platform, the wind tearing at his uniform, trying to rip him away. He caught the worker under the arms just as the cable gave way — a sound like a gunshot — and then Paisley was there, the Buster dropping into position with impossible timing, and they were falling onto the ramp together, tumbling, safe.\n\n\"Three,\" Odin breathed. \"Preston, release!\"\n\nPreston let go but his gauntlets didn't disengage.\n\n\"Preston!\" Odin shouted. \"Release! Now!\"\n\nA half-second. That's all it was. Preston's fingers found the emergency release a half-second too late. But in that half-second, the platform had already begun to twist, torquing against his magnetic grip. When his gauntlets finally let go, the platform didn't fall straight down.\n\nIt spun.\n\nThe main section — three tons of steel and shattered glass — careened sideways as it dropped, its trajectory warped by that single moment of hesitation. It clipped the secondary crane on its way down, a glancing blow that cut through its structure like a blade through paper. The massive arm of steel and hydraulics groaned, tilted, and then tore free entirely. It tumbled into the void, taking a section of scaffolding and two material pods with it.\n\nThey watched the cascade in frozen silence. Steel and glass and equipment worth more than most people earned in a decade, dissolving into the clouds below.\n\n\"Mission time: four minutes, eighteen seconds,\" Ava announced. Her voice was quieter now. \"All targets secured. Structural... secondary losses detected. Crane unit, scaffolding section seven through nine, two material pods.\" \n\nFour minutes and eighteen seconds. Three lives saved. Zero casualties.\n\n\nOdin looked at Preston. Preston looked at his gauntlets. Neither spoke, but both felt like they had lost.\n\n---\n\nThe hangar was cold when they landed. Not the temperature — the atmosphere.\n\nOdin stepped off the ramp, helmet under his arm, and immediately saw them: three holographic figures hovering beside Professor Brighthelm on the observation deck. The Global Hero Council. Their faces were the color of marble and just as expressive.\n\nCouncilwoman Hargrove. Councilman Steele. Director Vance. The people who decided whether the Vanguard program lived or died. They'd been watching the rescue in real-time, and now they were watching the Mights with the same clinical detachment they might give a malfunctioning piece of equipment.\n\n\"Professor,\" Odin started, but Brighthelm raised a hand. The holograms flickered once, twice, then vanished without a word.\n\nThe silence that followed was worse than any verdict.\n\n\"What just happened?\" Preston asked, pulling off his gauntlets. His voice was tight, defensive. \"We saved them. All three of them.\"\n\n\"You did.\" Brighthelm descended the stairs slowly, and Odin noticed for the first time how tired the old man looked. The lines around his eyes seemed deeper, the set of his shoulders heavier. \"Three lives, safe and sound. But the Council isn't looking at the lives, Preston. They're looking at the cost.\"\n\n\"The crane wasn't our fault,\" Willow said quickly. \"The structure was already compromised — \"\n\n\"The structure was stable enough to hold for another forty seconds.\" Brighthelm stopped at the base of the stairs, his gaze settling on Odin. \"Long enough for a different approach. A lighter touch.\"\n\nOdin felt the words like a blade between his ribs. He'd made the call. He'd told Preston to lock on. He'd prioritized speed over precision, and now...\n\n\"The Council has been evaluating alternatives to the Vanguard program for months,\" Brighthelm continued. \"Automated defense systems. AI-driven response protocols. Machines that calculate optimal outcomes, that don't make judgment calls under pressure.\" He paused. \"Machines that don't cause three hundred thousand credits in collateral damage while saving three lives.\"\n\n\"Machines can't do what we do,\" Stella said quietly. She was still holding her diagnostic tablet, the screen reflecting blue against her face. \"They can't adapt. They can't feel.\"\n\n\"Can't they?\" Brighthelm's voice was gentle, but the question cut deep. \"The Council doesn't see adaptation, Stella. They see variables. They see a team of talented children who've never faced a real villain — only simulations, structural failures, accidents. And today, they saw a rescue that cost more than it saved.\"\n\n\"That's not — \" Preston started.\n\n\"That's exactly how they see it.\" Brighthelm cut him off. \"There's a motion on the floor to mothball the Vanguard program. Permanently. Replace it with automated systems that don't make mistakes. Don't cause collateral. Don't cost more than they're worth.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a sentence.\n\n\"Disbanded?\" Willow's voice cracked on the word.\n\n\"They can't — \" Preston tried again.\n\n\"They can.\" Brighthelm's gaze swept across all of them. \"And they will, unless you give them a reason not to. The Hero Trials next week were supposed to be a demonstration. A formality. Now they're something else.\"\n\nAva had been silent until now, her fingers still moving across her wrist console, processing data even in crisis. She looked up, and Odin saw something in her eyes he rarely saw: uncertainty.\n\n\"What are they now?\" she asked.\n\n\"A survival hearing.\" Brighthelm let the words hang. \"You need to prove you're not just a liability the city can't afford. You need to prove that what you bring — the things machines can't calculate — is worth the cost. If you can't...\" He didn't finish. He didn't have to.\n\nOdin looked at his team. Preston, jaw tight, still staring at his gauntlets like they'd betrayed him. Willow, arms crossed, trying to hide the tremor in her hands. Stella, tablet forgotten, staring at nothing. Ava, already running calculations behind her eyes, looking for a solution in a problem that had no clean variables.\n\nHe looked down at his badge. The silver-and-blue crest of the Vanguard. He'd worn it every day for two years. He'd bled for it. They all had.\n\nAnd the Council wanted to replace them with algorithms because of one crane. One call. His call.\n\nOdin was tired. Tired of being graded. Tired of being watched. Tired of being told that saving lives wasn't enough if the math didn't work out.\n\nBut more than tired, he was angry. At the Council. At the system. At himself.\n\nHe looked up, and his voice was steady.\n\n\"Then we don't just pass the Trials. We prove that what we bring is worth more than what we cost.\"\n\nPreston's jaw unclenched. Willow's tremor stilled. Stella picked up her tablet. Ava's fingers resumed their dance across the console.\n\nThey were the Rescue Mights. And if the Council wanted proof, they'd get it.\n",
